        Hey, I\'m Malik LAFIA, a passionate and driven developer motivated by
        creating and enhancing various projects. You earned your high school diploma
        in 2018 in Benin and a Bachelor\'s degree in Information Systems with highest
        honors in 2022 in Dakar. You have experience in back-end and front-end development,
        particularly with Node.js, Angular, Symfony, and API Platform. Currently, you are seeking
        an apprenticeship and working on several projects, including a fitness tracking mobile
        application, with a methodical and innovative approach.
        I also have a strong interest in personal organization, developing diverse skill,
        (like Kotlin or CI/CD pipelines), and improving your physical and mental well-being.
        Your goal is to become the best version of yourself while sharing your journey with
        your audience on social media.
